# Arduino-Radar
Here is an easy project that you can easy make with an Arduino, Servomotor and Ultrasonic Sensor.

# Software that you need for the code 
# Arduino IDE and
# Processing (When you copy and paste the code on the processing text editor, change the Serial Port on which one you use, in my case the 
# Port is 'COM3' if yours is for example 'COM6' change it to 'COM6' and run the processing.


connect vcc of servomotor(red wire) and vcc of ultrasonic sensor to 5v of arduino
connect the gnd of ultrasonic sensor and servo(black wire) to ground of the arduino
connect trig and echo pin of ultrasonic sensor to 8 and 7 of arduino.
connect signal pin of servo to pin 9 of arduino.
connection with arduino nano for nano users

connect vcc of servomotor(red wire) and vcc of ultrasonic sensor to 5v of arduino
connect the gnd of ultrasonic sensor and servo(black wire) to ground of the arduino
connect trig and echo pin of ultrasonic sensor to D10 and D11 of arduino nano.
connect signal pin of servo to pin D12 of arduino nano.
In the code just change pins to D10, D11, D12.
